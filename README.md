# Library with reusable objects
This is the empty main package that is to contain every other ZCA_TBX_*-package. As an initial import, the two packages [ZCA_TBX_BASE (Basic objects)](https://github.com/JSB-Vienna/ZCA_TBX_BASE.git) and [ZCA_TBX_BASE_EXCEPTIONS (Basic exceptions)](https://github.com/JSB-Vienna/ZCA_TBX_BASE_EXCEPTIONS.git) are always required to be able to import one of the other packages.

## Please always start with the import of this package!!!

## Purpose / Objective
This package is intended as brackets for all the tools. Each of these tools should make a developer's life better and/or bring in a uniform codebase.

## Required packages
This package requires the following packages, which have to be imported in the order shown below:
* [ZCA_TBX_BASE (Basic objects)](https://github.com/JSB-Vienna/ZCA_TBX_BASE.git)
* [ZCA_TBX_BASE_EXCEPTIONS (Basic exceptions)](https://github.com/JSB-Vienna/ZCA_TBX_BASE_EXCEPTIONS.git)

Currently, the APACK information is not as resolved as I expected. May I have misunderstood something, but the required packages should be imported automatically if ABABGit is used and APM classes are defined for the sub-packages. Have a [look here](https://docs.abapgit.org/user-guide/reference/apack.html) for more details.

### Smaller heading (up to 6 hashes possible)

Styling the text [look here in the GitHub Help](https://docs.github.com/de/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Cool isn't it?
